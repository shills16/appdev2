1. Introduction (100-150 words)
    --> My name is Shiela Mae Miclat. I graduated last year with a 2 year degree in Associate in 
    Computer Technology, and I am currently studying again, pursuing a Bachelor of Science 
    in Information System. I have a strong passion for technology and enjoy learning about database
    management and programming. My interest lie on the website and application development with
    basic knowledge in HTML and CSS. I am not that good in coding but I have learned some programming
    languages like Python, Java, JavaScript, and PHP. As of now, I do not have experience with backend
    development. I know it is not that easy to understand but I am looking forward to learn more about it.

    Outside of academics, I enjoy watching movies/series, solving puzzles, and crocheting which somehow
    help me stay active and engaged. 


2. Course Expectations (200-300 words)
    --> What I want to achieve in this course is to make improvements in coding part because I am not
    that proficient in terms of writing codes logically. Though I am not that into coding at all, but at 
    least I want to equip myself with skills in programming, database management, and analytic thinking.
    I want to build a system that I think might help to solve some current issues in our society.

    Backend development is an essential skill that can greatly benefit both my studies and future career
    in Information System field. As a Bachelor of Science in Information Systems student, understanding
    backend development will help me gain deeper knowledge of databases, servers, and APIs. It will also
    enable me to implement theoritical concepts in practical projects and enhance my problem-solving skills.

    In my future career, backend development will open many opportunities, as business rely on efficient
    systems to manage data and operations. With these skills, I can work as a Software Developer, 
    Web Developer, or Database Administrator. Additionally, backend knowledge is also essential for 
    building scalable and secure applications, and therefore it will be beneficial in industries like 
    finance, healthcare, and e-commerce. And it will serve a strong foundation if I choose to become a 
    full-stack developer in the future.

    
3. Challenges ans Areas for Improvement (150-200 words)
    --> There are some topics that I fin it difficult to understand or improve on. I have encountered
    challenges in building APIs, error handling, and working with databases. These topics are essential
    for developing working and effective applications, but they require a strong understanding of coding
    principles and problem-solving skills.

    Among the challenges I encounter is developing APIs well, as it involves structuring endpoints,
    handling requests, and ensuring security. Another challenge is error handling, which requires 
    identifying debugging, and managing errors efficiently to maintain system stability. Also, dealing 
    with databases can be challenging.

    To overcome these challenges, I plan to take online courses in Youtube or from other platforms, 
    practice by building small projects, and study official documentation of database and API tools. 
    I will also engage in coding challenges that provides coding problems that strengthen problem-solving.
    By following this plan, I aim to improve my skills and become more confident in backend development.
    
4. Expectations from the instrutors (100-150 words)
    --> To succeed in this course, I expect the instructor to provide a clear explanations, structured
    lessons, and hands-on practice opportunities. Given that backend development involves complex topics
    like APIs, error handling, and databases, the instructor should break down concepts into sections
    that are easy to grasp with real-world examples to enhance understanding.

    Interactive live coding sessions and hands-on activities or projects will help reinforce learning.
    Providing well-organized course materials, such as slides, documentation, and recorded tutorial
    lectures, will be beneficial to review.


5. Final Thoughts (optional, 50-100 words)
    --> One of my main goals for this course is to gain a strong understanding of backend development.
    I want to be able to apply what I learn to real-world projects, which will help me prepare for future 
    job opportunities in the tech industry. Additionally, I aim to improve my problem-solving skills by 
    practicing debugging, optimizing queries, and handling different types of errors effectively.
