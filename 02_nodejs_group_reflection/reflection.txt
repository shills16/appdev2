Your Role:
    --> As one of the Project Managers of our group, I make schedule meetings, assign tasks to my members,
    check their work and give some comments on how to improve their work, and do some documents needed
    for our project. The major challenge that I have faced in this role is on how to manage my members.
    There are cases that they don't attend our meetings and I don't know what are their reasons because
    they are not communicating with me or to us. To be honest, I prefer to be managed than to manage others.
    But I realized that this role is actually awesome. Also, I learned that being a strict is one of the 
    characteristics that the project manager should possess.

Teamwork Experience:
    --> I would say the working in a team as a project manager is very challenging to me. But I think I am
    not that bad as I think I am in this role. I somehow managed and guided my members well enough last 
    semestercto accomplish their tasks with the help of my co-project manager. However, there are improvements
    that we need to work on. We need to communicate with each other more often about the project and not
    only abou the project as well as our well being if we are having some breakdowns or personal issues.
    We should be transparent to each other. And of course we need to improve our skills inline with our
    designated roles.

Personal Growth and Discipline:
    --> Of course as a propject manager, I want to improve my leadership, communication skills, and
    problem-solving skills.
